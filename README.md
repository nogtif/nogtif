## Hello there 👋

### I'm a Developer and Player!

- 🌱 I'm a software developer mainly working on web applications.
    I’m interested in building tools and systems that solve concrete problems, whether through web technologies, automation, or exploratory research projects.
    I also work on task automation using AI and on cross-disciplinary projects combining multiple domains such as artificial intelligence, history, finance, or data analysis.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love to read, play video games and pokémon!
